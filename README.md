# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

- ABC University (ABCU) was looking for a program that could help computer science advisors access student course information.
- With this, it was important to determine the sorting method that was efficient and effective for the provided data set. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

- I approached the problem by designing pseudocode for each data structure, then did some generalized run-time and memory analysis. This was important to understand as certain structures function better based on the type of program goals. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

- Any roadblocks that I encountered were quickly followed up by referencing the class zyBook. I also analyzed some of the provided code programs throughout the class to help in the final program. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

- This project has shown me the importance of planning in program design. In future developments, I will take the time to perform runtime analysis to determine the best data structure. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

- As displayed in my code, I ensured there was proper formatting throughout. I also implemented comments addressing the reason for blocks of code. These sections can also be updated as needed, in order to increase efficiency at a later date.
